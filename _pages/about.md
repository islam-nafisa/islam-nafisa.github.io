Hi, I’m Nafisa Islam — a tech enthusiast from Dhaka, Bangladesh, with a strong foundation in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering. I completed my B.Sc. (Engg.) from Chittagong University of Engineering & Technology (CUET) in July 2024, where I developed a passion for research and innovation at the intersection of Computer Vision, Artificial Intelligence, and Geospatial Analysis.

Currently, I’m working as a Tech Apprentice at IDLC Finance PLC, where I’m gaining hands-on experience in enterprise IT infrastructure, system monitoring, and software quality assurance. My professional journey also includes industrial training at Grameenphone Ltd., where I worked on core telecommunication and networking systems.

My academic and research pursuits focus on real-world applications of deep learning. I’ve presented and published work on satellite image segmentation, using architectures like Attentive U-Net and Residual Attention U-Net in international conferences such as ICICT 2024 and ECCE 2025. My undergraduate thesis contributed to the advancement of semantic segmentation in high-resolution geospatial imagery.

I’m continuously expanding my skill set in areas like automation testing, cybersecurity, and DevOps workflows. Alongside my technical pursuits, I enjoy mentoring students, exploring creative coding projects, and engaging in community and cultural initiatives.

I’m actively seeking graduate-level research opportunities, collaborations, or remote assistantships in AI, Software Engineering, and Cybersecurity domains. If you’re working on something impactful — let’s connect!
